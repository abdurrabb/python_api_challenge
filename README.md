# python_api_challenge

Lots of learning in this challenge!

# Imports
Beginning with imports. I made the fatal error of pushing my api_key into public view on git because I forgot to update my git ignore file with the correct naming. After an 11:30pm email alert from git and google that my api had been used for some density api look-ups, I quickly set restrictions and remedied the error.


# Get list of random latitudes and longitudes
I spent the most time learning how to do this. First, I attempted geopy. Later, citipy. Still, learning how to use the random.uniform method to arrange the coordinates involed relearning that latitude runs -90 to 90 degrees and longitude runs -180 to 180 degrees. 

# Zip lat & lng into tupled list
Straightforward proces

# Convert random coordinates into list of cities + details
Stored values in empty lists and set for loop through zipped list of coordinates with append the populate each empty list with the proper files
